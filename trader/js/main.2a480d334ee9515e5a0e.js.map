Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

It's built upon the\n * [`Transition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition)\n * component, so it inherits all of its props.\n *\n * `CSSTransition` applies a pair of class names during the `appear`, `enter`,\n * and `exit` states of the transition. The first class is applied and then a\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSSS transition. After the\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\n * transition state.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\"my-node\">\n *         <div>\n *           {\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\"}\n *         </div>\n *       </CSSTransition>\n *       <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\n * _appearance_.\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-node-enter {\n *   opacity: 0;\n * }\n * .my-node-enter-active {\n *   opacity: 1;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit {\n *   opacity: 1;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit-active {\n *   opacity: 0;\n *   transition: opacity: 200ms;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**.\n */\n\n\nvar CSSTransition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\n\n  function CSSTransition() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n\n    _this.onEnter = function (node, appearing) {\n      var _this$getClassNames = _this.getClassNames(appearing ?

with 2 observable properties that track\n * the status of the promise and returns it. The returned object has the following observable properties:\n *  - `value`: either the initial value, the value the Promise resolved to, or the value the Promise was rejected with. use `.state` if you need to be able to tell the difference.\n *  - `state`: one of `\"pending\"`, `\"fulfilled\"` or `\"rejected\"`\n *\n * And the following methods:\n * - `case({fulfilled, rejected, pending})`: maps over the result using the provided handlers, or returns `undefined` if a handler isn't available for the current promise state.\n * - `then((value: TValue) => TResult1 | PromiseLike<TResult1>, [(rejectReason: any) => any])`: chains additional handlers to the provided promise.\n *\n * The returned object implements `PromiseLike<TValue>`, so you can chain additional `Promise` handlers using `then`. You may also use it with `await` in `async` functions.\n *\n * Note that the status strings are available as constants:\n * `mobxUtils.PENDING`, `mobxUtils.REJECTED`, `mobxUtil.FULFILLED`\n *\n * fromPromise takes an optional second argument, a previously created `fromPromise` based observable.\n * This is useful to replace one promise based observable with another, without going back to an intermediate\n * \"pending\" promise state while fetching data. For example:\n *\n * @example\n * \\@observer\n * class SearchResults extends React.Component {\n *   \\@observable searchResults\n *\n *   componentDidUpdate(nextProps) {\n *     if (nextProps.query !== this.props.query)\n *       this.comments = fromPromse(\n *         window.fetch(\"/search?q=\" + nextProps.query),\n *         // by passing, we won't render a pending state if we had a successful search query before\n *         // rather, we will keep showing the previous search results, until the new promise resolves (or rejects)\n *         this.searchResults\n *       )\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return this.searchResults.case({\n *        pending: (staleValue) => {\n *          return staleValue || \"searching\" // <- value might set to previous results while the promise is still pending\n *        },\n *        fullfilled: (value) => {\n *          return value // the fresh results\n *        },\n *        rejected: (error) => {\n *          return \"Oops: \" + error\n *        }\n *     })\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * Observable promises can be created immediately in a certain state using\n * `fromPromise.reject(reason)` or `fromPromise.resolve(value?)`.\n * The main advantage of `fromPromise.resolve(value)` over `fromPromise(Promise.resolve(value))` is that the first _synchronously_ starts in the desired state.\n *\n * It is possible to directly create a promise using a resolve, reject function:\n * `fromPromise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(true), 1000))`\n *\n * @example\n * const fetchResult = fromPromise(fetch(\"http://someurl\"))\n *\n * // combine with when..\n * when(\n *   () => fetchResult.state !== \"pending\",\n *   () => {\n *     console.log(\"Got \", fetchResult.value)\n *   }\n * )\n *\n * // or a mobx-react component..\n * const myComponent = observer(({ fetchResult }) => {\n *   switch(fetchResult.state) {\n *      case \"pending\": return <div>Loading...</div>\n *      case \"rejected\": return <div>Ooops... {fetchResult.value}</div>\n *      case \"fulfilled\": return <div>Gotcha: {fetchResult.value}</div>\n *   }\n * })\n *\n * // or using the case method instead of switch:\n *\n * const myComponent = observer(({ fetchResult }) =>\n *   fetchResult.case({\n *     pending:   () => <div>Loading...</div>,\n *     rejected:  error => <div>Ooops.. {error}</div>,\n *     fulfilled: value => <div>Gotcha: {value}</div>,\n *   }))\n *\n * // chain additional handler(s) to the resolve/reject:\n *\n * fetchResult.then(\n *   (result) =>  doSomeTransformation(result),\n *   (rejectReason) => console.error('fetchResult was rejected, reason: ' + rejectReason)\n * ).then(\n *   (transformedResult) => console.log('transformed fetchResult: ' + transformedResult)\n * )\n *\n * @param {IThenable<T>} promise The promise which will be observed\n * @param {IThenable<T>} oldPromise?

The viewmodel proxies all enumerable properties of the original model with the following behavior:\n *  - as long as no new value has been assigned to the viewmodel property, the original property will be returned.\n *  - any future change in the model will be visible in the viewmodel as well unless the viewmodel property was dirty at the time of the attempted change.\n *  - once a new value has been assigned to a property of the viewmodel, that value will be returned during a read of that property in the future. However, the original model remain untouched until `submit()` is called.\n *\n * The viewmodel exposes the following additional methods, besides all the enumerable properties of the model:\n * - `submit()`: copies all the values of the viewmodel to the model and resets the state\n * - `reset()`: resets the state of the viewmodel, abandoning all local modifications\n * - `resetProperty(propName)`: resets the specified property of the viewmodel\n * - `isDirty`: observable property indicating if the viewModel contains any modifications\n * - `isPropertyDirty(propName)`: returns true if the specified property is dirty\n * - `changedValues`: returns a key / value map with the properties that have been changed in the model so far\n * - `model`: The original model object for which this viewModel was created\n *\n * You may use observable arrays, maps and objects with `createViewModel` but keep in mind to assign fresh instances of those to the viewmodel's properties, otherwise you would end up modifying the properties of the original model.\n * Note that if you read a non-dirty property, viewmodel only proxies the read to the model.

However, `flow` is not applicable as decorator, where `asyncAction` still is.\n *\n *\n *\n * `asyncAction` takes a generator function and automatically wraps all parts of the process in actions. See the examples below.\n * `asyncAction` can be used both as decorator or to wrap functions.\n *\n * - It is important that `asyncAction should always be used with a generator function (recognizable as `function*` or `*name` syntax)\n * - Each yield statement should return a Promise. The generator function will continue as soon as the promise settles, with the settled value\n * - When the generator function finishes, you can return a normal value. The `asyncAction` wrapped function will always produce a promise delivering that value.\n *\n * When using the mobx devTools, an asyncAction will emit `action` events with names like:\n * * `\"fetchUsers - runid: 6 - init\"`\n * * `\"fetchUsers - runid: 6 - yield 0\"`\n * * `\"fetchUsers - runid: 6 - yield 1\"`\n *\n * The `runId` represents the generator instance. In other words, if `fetchUsers` is invoked multiple times concurrently, the events with the same `runid` belong toghether.\n * The `yield` number indicates the progress of the generator. `init` indicates spawning (it won't do anything, but you can find the original arguments of the `asyncAction` here).\n * `yield 0` ... `yield n` indicates the code block that is now being executed. `yield 0` is before the first `yield`, `yield 1` after the first one etc. Note that yield numbers are not determined lexically but by the runtime flow.\n *\n * `asyncActions` requires `Promise` and `generators` to be available on the target environment.
